where first_sell_price is null
or    license_plate_number like '%00'
order by color,license_plate_number;

3.List all data of repairs that crossed a year boundary, i.e. the year of the end 
dates differ from year of the start date.Sort the list descending by the duration 
of the repairs.

select *
from carmechanic.m_repair
where extract(year from start_date) <> extract(year from end_date)
order by end_date-start_date desc;

4.What is the difference between highest and lowest price to which each car evaluated?
The cars should be represented in the result by their identifiers.Sort the list 
descending by the price difference.

select car_id, max(price) - min(price)
from carmechanic.m_car_evaluation
group by car_id
order by 2 desc;


5.Which cars were repaired for a total cost greater than 800 000 and what is the total
cost ? The cars should be represented in the result by their identifiers.

select car_id, sum(repair_cost)
from  carmechanic.m_repair
having sum(repair_cost) > 800000
group by car_id;

6.List all car evaluation with the following data: license plate number , evaluation date,
price .Sort the result ascending by the price.

select license_plate_number, evaluation_date, price
from carmechanic.m_car c
join carmechanic.m_car_evaluation e
on c.c_id = e.car_id
order by price;

7.List car model names whose first sell price of cars of that model was greater than 
5 million in 2006.

select  distinct cm_name
from carmechanic.m_car c
join carmechanic.m_car_model m

where extract(year from first_sell_date) = 2006
and first_sell_price > 5e6;

select distinct w_name Workshop
from carmechanic.m_workshop w
join carmechanic.m_works_for f
on w.w_id = f.workshop_id
join carmechanic.m_mechanic m
on f.mechanic_id = m.m_id
where m.address like 'Eger%';

9.List all data of car evaluations where the price is at least one million greater 
than the average.

select * 
from carmechanic.m_car_evaluation
where price - (select avg(price)
from carmechanic.m_car_evaluation) >= 1e6;

10.List the license plate number and color of cars having the highest evaluation 
price.

select license_plate_number, color
from carmechanic.m_car c
join carmechanic.m_car_evaluation e
on c.c_id = e.car_id
where price = (select max(price)
from carmechanic.m_car_evaluation);
